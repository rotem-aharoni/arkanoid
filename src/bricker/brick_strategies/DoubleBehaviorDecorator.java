 * Interface representing a decorator for implementing double behavior in collision strategies for bricks.
 * This interface extends the CollisionStrategy interface, allowing classes that implement it to act as
 * decorators that provide additional behavior to existing collision strategies for bricks.
 * Double behavior decorators modify the collision behavior of bricks in the game, typically by applying
 * special effects or interactions when collisions occur.
 * Classes that implement this interface are expected to provide concrete implementations for the methods
 * defined in the CollisionStrategy interface.
